    <h1>The Three Ways of Denoting Color</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>RGB Values:  These express colors in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used to make it up. Example: rgb(100,100,90)</li>
        <li>Hex Codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red breen and blue in a color, preceded by a '#' character. Example : #ee3e80</li>
        <li>Color Names:There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. I have used several in the previous chapter. Example: DarkCyan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CSS3 has also introduced another way to denote color called HSLA which will be covered later</p>

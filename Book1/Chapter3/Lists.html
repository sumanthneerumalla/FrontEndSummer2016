<h1>I only have 30 minutes till midnight to make some commits to this project otherwise I'll have an empty spot on my activity chart.</h1>
<p>This chapter is very short, and its about lists, so lets get started!</p>

<h1>Ordered lists</h1>
<p>The ordered list is created with the ol tag. Lets make a list of things that I have to do tomorrow. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Wake up, realize how fortunate I am to be living in a country that gives me opportunities like this</li>
    <li>Try to take into account the things I've taken for granted, that other people in less fortunate situations can only imagine having</li>
    <li>Accept that on an individual level, its my responsibility to make the most of what I have, because not everyone has been as fortunate as I have been</li>
    <li>Put myself atleast a little bit outside of my comfort zone, today, tomorrow, and every day if its possible</li>
    <li>Remember that I only have a limited amount of my time in life with my family and friends. Make some room between all the things that I do so that I can spend time with them</li>
    <li>Evaluate whether I have been goal driven recently, and whether my goals need to be realigned.</li>
    <li>Last but not least. Learn from any mistakes that I have made recently</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, that was more of an introspective journal entry than an actual list of things to do, and its not even complete, but i'm running out of time so maybe we'll hit that in the next type of list, the <b>unordered list</b></p>

<h2>An unordered list of ingredients. Try to guess what the ingredients make</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>A quick note</h2>
<p>Browsers indent lists by default so keep that in mind. By the way the ingredients are for cookies</p>

<h2>Definition lists</h2>
<p>The definition list is created with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms and definition. The list contains dt and dd elements. dt elements contain the term being defined, and the dd elements contain the term being defined. It is possible to have more than one term per definition.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Sashimi</dt>
    <dd>Sliced raw fish, a type of sushi</dd>
    <dt>Scale</dt>
    <dd>A device used to meausre the weight of an ingredient</dd>
    <dt>Procrastinate</dt>
    <dd>To put off what you can easily do now, for tomorrow.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>And finally, the last type of list: The Nested List</h2>
<p>It is possible to put lists inside of lists. Nested elements are typically just indented further than the parent list item.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mousse</li>
    <li>Pastries
        <ul>
            <li>Croissant</li>
            <li>Palmier</li>
            <li>Baguette</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Tarts</li>
</ul>

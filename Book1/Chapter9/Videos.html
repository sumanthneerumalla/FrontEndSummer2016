<h1>The 'video' element</h1>
<p>The new html5 'video' element is used to embed html5 videos. It has a src attribute that specifies the path of the video file. The 'poster' attribute allows you to define a poster image to show while the image loads. It also has a width and height attributes that can be defined. When the 'autoplay' attribute is used it doesn't require a value but will tell the browser to automatically play the video. The 'preload' attribute tells the browser to either not load, load the video, or only load the meta data of the video.</p>

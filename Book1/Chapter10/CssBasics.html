Its an empty element with an href attribute linking to the location of the css file, a 'type' attribute that should be set to the value of 'text/css' and a 'rel' attribute that specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The 'rel' attribute should be set to 'stylesheet' when linking to a css file.</p>

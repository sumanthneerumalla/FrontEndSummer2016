        <dt>Doctypes</dt>
        <dd>Because of the different html standards that are out there, it is recommended to insert html doctypes at the beginning of an html document so that browsers can render the html page properly based on the standards that were used to write the html page</dd>
        <dt>Comments in HTML</dt>
        <dd>It is possible to write inline comments in html code by wrapping them with the &lt!-- and the --&gt wrappers. The contents of the comments are not rendered within a browser</dd>
        <dt>The ID attribute</dt>
        <dd>Every html element can carry the id attribute,which is used to uniquely identify  one <i>individual</i> element within a document.</dd>
        <dt>The class attribute</dt>
        <dd>The class attribute can be used to group multiple elements within an HTML document so that they can be styled or manipulated later with CSS or Javascript. The value of this attribute should describe the classit belongs to and should be all <b>one</b> word. When an element has to belong to several classes, it is easily denoted by separating the multiple class values by a space. For example the an element with this value would belong to the 'important' class as well as the 'admittance' class. <blockquote>(class = "important admittance")</blockquote></dd>

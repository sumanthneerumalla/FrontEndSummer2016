    <h1>LInking to other sites</h1>
    <p>Links are created using the a element, which has an attribute called href. I dont know what it means but it holds a quote of the link that we want to point to. Here are some websites that i use frequently:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a> </li>
        <li><a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> </li>
        <li><a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> </li>
        <li><a href="http://tweetdeck.twitter.com">Tweetdeck</a> </li>
    </ol>


    <h1>Linking to other pages on the same site</h1>
    <p>The previous links were given using their absolute urls. It is also possible to link to pages using relative urls.Here's a link to another page in this same directory: <a href="Links2.html">Links2</a> It is however, possible to also link to page in parent and child directories using relative file location descriptors</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="../index.html">Index Page</a> </li>
        <li><a href="../Chapter1/BodyHead&Title.html">Chapter 1 Content</a> </li>
        <li><a href="../Chapter2/Text.html">Chapter 2 Content</a> </li>
        <li><a href="../Chapter3/Lists.html">Chapter 3 Content</a> </li>
        <li><a href="../Chapter4/Links.html">Chapter 4 Content</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p>When linking to the same file from different relative locations on the website it is necessary to write two different urls</p>

<h1>Box Dimensions</h1>
<p>By default a box is sized just large enough to the hold the contents inside of it. This can be customized with the 'width' and 'height' properties. The most popular values are given in pixels, but it can also be done in percentages. When percentages are used, the percentage refers to the dimensions of the page, or applies to the size of the box that the box specified is nested within. When 'em's are used, the size of the box is defined by the size of the text. Percentages and 'em's are being used more and more often in order to provide responsive design to different-sized screens.</p>

<h1>Limiting Width and Height</h1>
<p>some pages expand and shrink to fid the size of the users screen. The 'min-width' and 'min-height' properties allow you to set the smallest size that a box can be. The 'max-width' and 'max-height' properties allow you to specify the largest size a box can be. Sometimes due to dimensional restrictions, text inside the boxes may overflow out of their boxes and overlap with the contents of other boxes. This can be handled with the 'overflow' property</p>

<h>Overflowing Content</h>
<p>The 'overflow' property tells the browser what to do when the content of a box overflows its boundaries.</p>

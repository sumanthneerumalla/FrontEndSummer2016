<h1>Box Dimensions</h1>
<p>By default a box is sized just large enough to the hold the contents inside of it. This can be customized with the 'width' and 'height' properties. The most popular values are given in pixels, but it can also be done in percentages. When percentages are used, the percentage refers to the dimensions of the page, or applies to the size of the box that the box specified is nested within. When 'em's are used, the size of the box is defined by the size of the text. Percentages and 'em's are being used more and more often in order to provide responsive design to different-sized screens.</p>

<h1>Limiting Width and Height</h1>
<p>some pages expand and shrink to fid the size of the users screen. The 'min-width' and 'min-height' properties allow you to set the smallest size that a box can be. The 'max-width' and 'max-height' properties allow you to specify the largest size a box can be. Sometimes due to dimensional restrictions, text inside the boxes may overflow out of their boxes and overlap with the contents of other boxes. This can be handled with the 'overflow' property</p>

<h1>Overflowing Content</h1>
<p>The 'overflow' property tells the browser what to do when the content of a box overflows its boundaries. When set equal to 'hidden', the browser will just simply hide the content that cannot fit inside of the box. When set to 'scroll', the browser will add a scrollbar to the box so that users can see the missing content.</p>

<h1>Border, Margin, and Padding</h1>
<p>Most borders are by default set to invisible in HTML. Margins are the space outside the border, and padding is the space between the border and the content in the box. The three are important to consider because when borders contact each other without any margin, they look twice as thick and can lead to a bad whitespace on a web page. The border can quickly be customized with a single property called 'border'. The first value is the borders thickness, the second is the style (dotted, dashes, etc..), and the third is the color.</p>

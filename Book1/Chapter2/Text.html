    <h1> This text is wrapped with a h1 header tag, which is the largest heading size</h1>
    <p> Headers often have paragraphs under neath them. The paragraph tag is used to separate text into manageable chunks</p>

    <h2> This text is wrapped with a h2 header tag, which happens to be smaller</h2>
    <p> Header size ranges from h1 all the way to h6</p>

    <h3> This text is wrapped with a h3 header tag, which happens to be even smaller</h3>
    <p> Here we introduce the bold tag which makes words look <b>bold</b>. What a surprise, I know. HTML also lets you make words look italic. Can you <b>believe</b> it? Whoops that wasn't it. <i> Here we go</i>. Now please enjoy some <i>italicized</i> Loren Ipsum.</p>

    <h5>Superscripts and subscripts</h5>
    <p>Sometimes there's the need to use <sup>superscripts</sup> and <sub>subscripts</sub>. What for? To write dates like 4<sup>th</sup> of September , impress people with physics formulas (E = MC<sup>2</sup>), or if you're so inclined, write down chemistry formulas like CO<sub>2</sub>. I'm currently on page <sup>46</sup>/<sub>496</sub> in this book. See what I did there?</p>

    <h6>We've finally reached header size h6, if you havent been keeping track</h6>
    <p>Also you cant see it but theres a










                                                           LOT of empty white space in this page. Its             actually                  quite              obnoxious.                          Check                      the                 source to                            see                        for                  yourself.
